##Installation
To install the locales, navigate to your ArchivesSpace installation directory, and then overwrite /locales/en.yml and /locales/enums/en.yml.

To install the other plugins, install them in the plugins directory of ArchivesSpace, replicating the directory structure the files are in on Github.

##Usage
After installing the files, stop Archivesspace. Then make sure your config.rb file has the line "AppConfig[:plugins] = ['local',  'lcnaf', 'aspace-public-formats']" uncommented, and that it includes 'local'.

Restart ArchivesSpace
